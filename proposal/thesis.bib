abstract = {Non-functional specifications of software components are considered an important asset in constructing dependable systems, since they enable early Quality of Service (QoS) evaluations. Several approaches for the QoS analysis of component-based software architectures have been introduced. However, most of these approaches do not consider the integration into the development process sufficiently. For example, they envision a pure bottom-up development or neglect that system architects do not have complete information for QoS analyses at their disposal. We extent an existing component-based development process model by Cheesman and Daniels to explicitly include early, model-based QoS analyses. Besides the system architect, we describe further involved roles. Exemplary for the performance domain, we analyse what information these roles can provide to construct a performance model of a software architecture.},

abstract = {Many enterprises, organizations, governments and militaries are all facing a problem: how to protect their confidential documents, especially how to prevent them from being unauthorized copied or redistributed is a serious trouble as lacking of mechanism to forbid this action at present. In this paper we propose a Secure Confidential Document Model (SCDM). The document under the proposed model is divided into logical blocks based on the content, and a lot of useful information is also included in this model. So it can be easily and flexibly controlled in access and distribution no matter what format the document is. Moreover a record is also included in the proposed model so it will be easy to trace the confidential documents. A case of its application in confidential documents management system is introduced to illustrate the key ideas of the proposed document model.},
